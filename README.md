 Reflection 
 </h1>

<p>
 This project gave me the perfert opportunity to show what I have learned about HTML & CSS.  I always understood about how certain tags worked.  For example, I learned about background-color and padding, but putting different tags with each other was certainly going to be a challenge for me.  Therefore, I had to take a handful of time to overcome this challenge.  I spent time using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools </a> to help me better understand how all tags worked.  I even took the time to learn about new tags and even alternative tags.
